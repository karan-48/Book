    <h1>ABOUT MOVIE</h1>
 <div style="white-space:pre;"> No wonder they say that man's best friend is a dog. There has been many movies made about self discovery,
     finding oneself and this is one of the best in that list. Here our Protagonist Dharma (Rakshit Shetty) is the kinda guy who'd be hated by kids and
     families in the neighbourhood. But he is also the kinda guy who values his solitude with anxiety simmering below the surface.
     His seemingly normal life of is suddenly unsettled, the constant ringing of his door bells, presence of people, all for the uninvited guest, our snow loving Charlie.
     It's only when he reintegrates with his surrounding which leads to a beautiful, affectionate, touching film, a journey that touches on topics of life, pet adoption,
     overcoming anxiety, and most importantly love.
     Firstly, many will be familiar with the key concept of the film and it be no longer surprising but trust me you will be proven wrong.

    From choo choo to naming Charlie after the great Chaplin, there are a lot of such touching moments in the film and
     i'm sure it will be very hard to hold back tears while watching. At the same time, the picture is a wonderful sketch
     of the soul of an ordinary Dharma and Charlie's last wish as they both find love, including a new addition to the family.

    To conclude "777 Charlie" is good movie with very little flaws, also it is cleverly constructed love story, where the emotions
     are truly at heart and it perfectly sums up "The tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug." I went to the film and knew that I would enjoy
     it and with a brilliant cast and a cute dog, which is impossible not to love. I strongly recommend to stop looking for
     similarities with other movies that shares the same theme and enjoy this wholesome journey.

<b><div style="white-space:pre;">
    A bold movie by Vivek Sir. This shows the trauma the Kashmiri pandits have gone through and still haunts 30+ years. The nation needs to know this.
    Many people still doesn't visualize the horror experienced by Kashmiri Pandits. It is seen as a simple terror strike. But it is hard hittting event
    of bloodshed human brutality and families being displaced.

    Vivek Sir is a visionary who comes with innovative flicks imbibed with emotions and ideals. This is going to be one of his best work. Well done sir.

    Now about technical aspects, it falls a bit short from being a masterpiece. The fireworks needed to be real, some characters remained flawed,
    some edges left out. But Vivek Sir daringly showed the gruesome crimes of the tragedy. The violence and fearsome part are gripping while other
    parts sometimes loses the grip. The tragedy of the event gets well portrayed, gives the fear.
